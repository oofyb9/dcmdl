> *the best multimedia downloader for all websites*

## 🌟 why so special?

- custom spotify downloader (absolute pain to build)
- easy access to all your favorite downloaders
- no-hassle install
- ⭐️*plugins*⭐️

## ℹ️ wtf is this 🥀

you know when you have like 5+ downloaders and it's hard to manage them all because you're a dumbass and make this instead?  
__that's why i made this__  
with DCMDL, you don't have to worry about managing downladers and running `pip install -U yt-dlp gallery-dl instaloader` anymore!

you simply run `pip install -U dcmdl` (so simple)
and then `dcmdl dl "https://www.youtube.com/watch/?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"` *__and that's it__*

### ✍️ who tf wrote ts 🥀

yes. i (@oofybruh9) wrote this shit.
i am a 🇲🇽-🇺🇸 dev who's purpose in life is to make the internet a better place (or entertain you with my funny videos) and to make digital life __*just work*__ ™️.

## 🚀 usage

```shell
